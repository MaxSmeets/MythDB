# The Ashen Serpents

*A foundational creature of the Ashfall mythos.*

---

## Overview

The **Ashen Serpents** are rare, brown-grey, scale-covered serpents believed to emerge in regions following large-scale loss of life. Unlike scavengers, they do not merely consume the dead — they *repurpose death itself* as material for new life.

They are considered sacred, feared, and misunderstood in equal measure.

## Physical Description

- Average length: **80–120 cm**
- Average weight: **~1 kg**
- Scales range from ash-grey to soot-black
- Eyes appear milky white in low light

> Witnesses often report that the serpents appear *already ancient* at birth, as if time itself has brushed past them.

## Behavior & Ecology

### Feeding

Ashen Serpents feed primarily on:
- Corpses left unburied
- Battlefield remains
- Mass grave sites

They **do not hunt living prey**.

### Lifecycle

1. Emergence from ashen soil
2. Rapid growth phase (weeks)
3. Long dormancy periods
4. Eventual crystallisation into bone-ash husks

| Culture | Interpretation | Response |
